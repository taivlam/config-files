# Mouse Configurator

I will upload the config file here, when pop-os/mouse-configurator#24 is fixed.

The most I've seen so for is this general mouse customization support
[page](https://support.system76.com/articles/custom-mouse-buttons/) from
System76.

This application was designed for the
[HP 935 Creator Mouse](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-935-creator-wireless-mouse),
though the
[HP 935 Creator Wireless Mouse](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-silver-930-creator-wireless-mouse)
also works with this application.  The HP 935 Creator Mouse was also sold as an
[accessory](https://www.phoronix.com/review/hp-dev-one) to the
[HP Dev One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_EliteBook#HP_Dev_One).
