# Diary app

I have customized the CSS to make a very rough black theme while reading
entries for the [Diary](https://billthefarmer.github.io/diary/) app on Android.
Diary's source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/billthefarmer/diary) and
is currently only distributed on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.billthefarmer.diary/).

(I will add the info sources I used to do this soon...)
