# Personal configuration files
I have some [configuration files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file)
saved here, especially if they are short and rarely change.

There is a bit more here than just dotfiles (reference
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments)
or the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles) on this topic for
more detail).

## License
The configuration files are licensed under the [GPLv3 license](LICENSE).
